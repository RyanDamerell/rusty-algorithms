# Rusty algorithms

For educational purposes, I decided to make an open-source repository of a bunch of standard algorithms implemented in pure rust (with minimal non-standard libraries). If you know the algorithms and want to learn rust, or if you know rust and want to learn the algorithms, I think this could help.

## The state of this project

This is still very much a work in progress. Some algorithms are written, very few are fully documented. Still, any piece of this project is fully provided under [the Unlicense](http://unlicense.org), so if you see something you want to use, go for it.
